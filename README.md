# crypto_rnn

Implementation of a simple RNN with LSTM layers predicting whether price of a coin is going to go up or down.
If the price is going up in the future, the value will be close to one, otherwise close to zero.
After 10 epochs, the validation loss was around 0.68, and the validation accuracy was around 56%.
